## 0.2.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bac700d]
- Updated dependencies [7d32f8a]
  - @shipbench/board@0.2.0

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 09068e0: No functional changes. The package contents are identical to 0.1.0.
  
  This release exists to exercise the release pipeline after it moved from a
  long-lived npm token to GitHub OIDC trusted publishing, and to attach the
  provenance attestations that 0.1.0 shipped without. Attestations are applied at
  publish time and published versions are immutable, so verifying the fix required
  publishing a version rather than amending one.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4920743: First public release.
  
  ShipBench is Git-native project management for solo developers: the task board
  lives in the repository as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, so Git carries
  the history and every client is optional.
  
  - **`shipbench`** — the CLI. `shipbench init` scaffolds a `.shipbench/`
    directory into any Git repository; `shipbench board` serves a local Kanban
    board with live file watching.
  - **`@shipbench/core`** — the headless library the CLI is built on. No
    filesystem, UI, or network of its own; all I/O goes through a
    `StorageAdapter`, with local-filesystem and GitHub Contents API
    implementations included.
  - **`@shipbench/board`** — the React board. Published so the CLI and
    out-of-repository hosts can resolve it; not a supported standalone library.
